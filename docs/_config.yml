  My name is Jan, I am 23 years old, and I am currently studying Computer Science at the University of Southern Denmark.
  I just started my 5th semester in september 2024.
  After completing my Bachelor's degree, I plan to continue with my Master's degree in Computer Science.
  Outside of academics I love to run, spend time with friends and if the weather is great during the summer months I like to ride my bike.

          I’ve developed a Discord bot using Python, designed to fetch and display player statistics for Clash Royale based on user input. The bot allows users to enter a player tag and receive real-time data such as experience level, trophies, wins, and losses.
